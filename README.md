# About

This robot was designed to seek and pick up red ping pong balls scattered around an environment

The robocar will locate the ping pong balls with an RGBD camera. It will then drive to the ball to perform a recovery maneuver using the webcam. It will be equipped with a suction tube to pick up the ping pong balls.


## Info

### Phase 1
- Locate ping pong balls in an open and unobstructed environment
- Pick up ping pong balls
- Use Lidar for collision avoidance
- Make decisions on what ping pong balls to pick up first

### Phase 2
- All elements of Phase 1
- Locate ping pong balls with obstructions where they must be sought out by navigating around the environment
- ROS1 SLAM
- Extensive use of Lidar
