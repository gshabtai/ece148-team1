## Nodes

</div>


### **webcam_node**

Associated file: **webcam_node.py**

Associated Topics:
- Publishes to the [camera](#camera) topic

This node simply reads from the camera with cv2's interface and publishes the image to the
[camera](#camera) topic. Before publishing, the image is reformatted from the cv image format
so it can be passed through the ROS topic message structure.

## Troubleshooting

</div>

#### **Camera not working** 

If while running <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg#camera-navigation-calibration" >camera_nav_calibration_launch.py</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg#camera-navigation" >camera_nav_launch.py</a> and if the cv2 windows do not open, then follow the procedure below to potentially resolve the issue.

1. Check if host jetson can recognize the camera `lsusb`
1. Check that the docker container can recognize the camera `lsusb`
1. Make sure camera is plugged in all the way into its USB socket (**if camera was unplugged, the docker container needs to be restarted in ordered to be recognized**)
1. verify x-11 forwarding was setup `xclock` should result in an analog clocking popping up
1. See if image feed is coming through in another application like cheese. (Enter `cheese` into terminal window)
1. Check to see if the camera topic is publishing data `ros2 topic echo /camera/color/image_raw`
1. Verify that the calibratrion values found in <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg#camera-navigation-calibration" >camera_nav_calibration_launch.py</a> were loaded properly when running <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg#camera-navigation" >camera_nav_launch.py</a> (Values will be printed to the terminal first when running the camera_nav_launch file) 
1. Restart ROS2 daemon  `ros2 daemon stop` then `ros2 daemon start`
1. Reboot if none of the above worked and try again `sudo reboot now`

If the camera is still not working after trying the procedure above, then it could be a hardware issue. (Did the car crash?)

#### **Lidar not working**

1. Check if host jetson can recognize the lidar (for sick/livox/bpearl) `ping ip_address_of_lidar` (for ld06 and rp) `lsusb`
1. Check that the docker container can recognize the lidar (for sick/livox/bpearl) `ping ip_address_of_lidar` (for ld06 and rp) `lsusb`
1. Make sure lidar is plugged in all the way into its ethernet or USB socket (**if lidar was unplugged, the docker container needs to be restarted in ordered to be recognized**)
1. Check to see if the lidar topic is publishing data `ros2 topic echo /scan`
1. Restart ROS2 daemon  `ros2 daemon stop` then `ros2 daemon start`
1. Reboot if none of the above worked and try again `sudo reboot now`

If the lidar is still not working after trying the procedure above, then it could be a hardware issue. (Did the car crash?)
